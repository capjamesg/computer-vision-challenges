I love learning by trying to solve problems. I have made a few computer vision challenges that will allow you to practice your computer vision skills. You will likely learn something new in the process, too!

## Challenges

1. [Validate Detections in Rows and Columns](https://jamesg.blog/2024/02/20/validate-detections-in-rows-and-columns/)
2. [Identify Missing Annotations](https://jamesg.blog/2024/02/21/missing-annotations/)

## Instructions

All of the instructions for each challenge is in the corresponding blog post.

Need a hint? You can email me at readers [at] jamesg [dot] blog and I can give you some rough direction.

If you complete a challenge, feel free to email readers [at] jamesg [dot] blog with your solution. I would love to learn how you solved each problem!
